## What is this?

A Go/weiqi/igo/baduk/goe engine written in Rust.
(As should have been obvious from the punny name.)

## How does it work?

Math.

## Anything else you want to say?

One day in the future I might write some useful documentation.
Until then, feel free to e-mail me with questions.
(Well, after then, too, but not before consulting the docs.)
